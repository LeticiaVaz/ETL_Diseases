# ETL_Diseases

## We have decided to pull three datasets, each for a different disease outbreak. Our inspiration is, of course, the recent Coronavirus outbreak. 
## The diseases we have chosen are Coronavirus, Ebola, and SARS. Once the datasets are pulled, we will transform them and then load them into a database.

Once you have identified your datasets, perform ETL on the data. Make sure to plan and document the following:

* The sources of data that you will extract from.
	Our data was retrieved from Kaggle.com. We pulled several datasets from this site all related to medical data.

* The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).
    The headers had to be renamed, Removed NaN's and irrenous data, Dropped columns, and formated data.

* The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).
	The data sets were loaded into a relational database

* The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.
You will be required to submit a final technical report with the above information and steps required to reproduce your ETL process.
