# ETL_Diseases

## We have decided to pull three datasets, each for a different disease outbreak. Our inspiration is, of course, the recent Coronavirus outbreak. 
## The diseases we have chosen are Coronavirus, Ebola, and SARS. Once the datasets are pulled, we will transform them and then load them into a database.
